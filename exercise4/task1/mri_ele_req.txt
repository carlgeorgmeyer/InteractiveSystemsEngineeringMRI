elements

	An MRI system consists of four major components:
		a main magnet formed by superconducting coils
		gradient coils
		radiofrequency (RF) coils
		and computer systems
		(Each component has safety considerations)
	
	
	


requirements

	must be safe
		must not be dangerious towards the patient
	must be accessable
		disabled people shouldnt have an issue using the machine
	must be comfortable
		so the patient can relax and not be distracted by the machine
	must be energy efficient
		min max the amount of energy needed for the individual application
	must have a good computing unit
		to elavate the procedure and possible make it faster
